### [\*]. Normalization
* It is the process of determining how much redundancy exists in a table. 
* The goals of normalization are to:
  1. Be able to characterize the level of redundancy in a relational schema.
  2. Provide mechanisms for transforming schemas in order to remove redundancy.

* Higher normal forms have less redundancy, and as a result, fewer update problems.

**1. First Normal Form:**
* The domain of an attribute must include only atomic (simple, indivisible) values and that the value of any attribute in a tuple must be a single value i.e if a relation contains a multi-valued attribute, it violates 1NF

**2. Second Normal Form:**
* To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form (1NF) and it must not contain any partial dependencies. So a relation is in 2NF as long as it has no partial dependencies, i.e., no non-prime attributes (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of a composite primary key of the table.

**3. Third Normal Form:**
* To be in 3NF:
    1. It should be in the second normal form.
    2. It should not have transitive dependency.

**4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form:**
* To be in BCNF:
    1. It should be in the Third normal form.
    2. And, for any dependency A â†’ B, A should be a super key.
