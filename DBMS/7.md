### [\*] SQL
* SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in a relational database.

**DDL: Data Definition Language**

|S.No| Command       | Description            |
|----|---------------|:----------------------:|
|1.  | CREATE        | Creates new table      |
|2.  | ALTER         | Modifies existing table|
|3.  | DROP          | Deletes an entire table|


**DML: Data Manipulation Language**

|S.No| Command       | Description            |
|----| --------------|:----------------------:|
|1.  | SELECT        | Retrieve record from table[s]|
|2.  | INSERT        | Creates a record         |
|3.  | IPDATE        | Modifies record         |
|4.  | DELETE        | Deletes record         |


#### [\*] SQL Data Types
* Numeric, Data Tyime, date, time etc
* For string:
    * char : Max 8,000 characters (fixed length)
    * varchar : Max 8,000 (variable length)
    * varchar(max) : Max 2e+21 (variable length)
    * text  :   Variable length with max 2,147,483,647 characters

#### [\*] SQL Constraints
* These are the rules enforced in data columns in a table.
1. NOT NULL constraint 
2. The DEFAULT constraint
3. The UNIQUE constraint
4. The PRIMARY key constraint
5. The FOREIGN Key constraint
6. The CHECK constraint  : Used to apply business logic check, Eg: in Customer table. if customer.age > 18 then only he can buy, this can be added using CHECK.


#### [\*] Aggregate Functions in SQL
1. COUNT function
* Return the number of rows which matches the criteria:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

2. SUM function
* REturns total sum of numeric column.
```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

3. AVG function
* The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.
```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

4. MAX function
* The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

5. MIN function
* The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### [\*] SQL Joins
* It is used to combine rows from 2 or more tables based on common columns.

1. INNER JOIN/JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2 ... 
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```

2. LEFT JOIN/LEFT OUTER JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```

3. RIGHT JOIN/RIGHT OUTER: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```


#### [\*] SQL Queries

* WHERE vs HAVING in SQL ? 
- The main difference between WHERE and HAVING clause comes when used together with GROUP BY clause, In that case WHERE is used to filter rows before grouping and HAVING is used to exclude records after grouping.

1. retrieve the ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table, where the salary is greater than $20,000 (inclusive) and the age is less than 25 years.
```sql
SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY >= 20000 AND age < 25;
```

2. fetch the ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table, where the salary is greater than $50,000 or the age is less than 25 years

```sql
SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 50000 OR age < 25;
```


3. fetch list of customers sorted by name in descending order
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS
ORDER BY NAME DESC;
```

4. fetch country-wise number of customers.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```
