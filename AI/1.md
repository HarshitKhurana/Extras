### [\*] Intro to AI

Ques: What is AI ?? </br>
A: Science and eng of making intyelligent machines
 * Weak AI: These are the machines which perform a small set of dedicated task only. Eg: Alexa, Google Search etc , these can learn the task quickly and do it but cannot reason it, wehreas a human can.
 * Strong AI: These sort of AI are the ones which possess the ability to perform any task a human can.
 * Super Intelligence AI: Which can bypass human intelligence.

Ques: ML/AI ?  </br>
A: ML lies in AI, ML is one way to implement AI.
 * ML: It is a subset of AI, in which the machine learn automatically and improves from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Ques: Solving a problem using ML. </br>
A: Steps:
 1. Objective definition
 2. Data gathering
 3. Data Cleaning
 4. Data exploration (understanding pattern, co-relation etc)
 5. Model buiulding
 6. Model evaluation & optimisation
 7. Prediction/Outcome (can be binary/continous)


Ques: Types of ML </br>
A: Following types :- </br>

**1. Supervised Learning:**
* In this the machine/model is trained by using labelled data, which acts as a guide for the model to learn.
* The training data set is perfectly labelled and the machine learns the attributes based on that data.
* Eg: Classification problem:
  - identify dog/cat in a mix collection of cat and dog photos
  - The output is labelled data with dog/cat
* Helps in solving **Regression & Classification** problems.
* Algos: Linear regression, SVM, KNN etc

**2. Un-Supervised Learning:**
* In this the model is simply fed data and the model itself tries to find out various patterns and co-relation between the attributes of the object in the data. (*without guidance i.e no labelled data*)
* The model creates clusters of the output based on feature/attribute similarity of the objects.
* Eg: Classification problem:
  * identify dog/cat in a mix collection of cat and dog photos
  * The output will be 2 seperate clusters, with all dog photos being in one and cat photos being in the other.
* Helps in solving **Association & Classification** problems.
* Algos: K-means, C-means etc

**3. Reinforcement Learning:**
* In this type of ML, the model is put in an environment and it learns to behave in that environment by performing actions and observing the rewards/penalties which it gets from those actions.
* Eg: 
  * Stranded on an un-known area, you eventually learn to live in that area. AplhaGo   
* Its kinda bruteforce with rewards/penalties to enhance learning.
* Helps in solving **Reward based** problems.
* Algos: SARSA, Q-Learning etc
