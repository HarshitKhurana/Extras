<b>Ques</b> : Diff between structs and classes.</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : Nothing, except the fact that by default member in struct are public whereas in class are private. 

<b>Ques</b> : When to use class vs when use struct ?</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : When creating a new data-type only (and no function is to be created ) then use structs, when need to create functions too then use class. Basically think of class as a data-type which will act as an object whereas struct is just another user-defined data-type.

<b>Ques</b> : Diff between structs in C and C++?</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : In C, in order to have functions in 'struct' the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12642830/can-i-define-a-function-inside-a-c-structure">only way is function pointers</a>, whereas in C++ we can have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13125944/function-for-c-struct">functions as a part of struct</a>.

<b>Ques</b> : Type of constructors ?</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : Default , Parameterised , Copy Constructor.

<b>Ques</b> : Do you think constructors create objects ?</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/85-constructors/">No they don't, the compiler sets up the memory allocation for the object prior to the constructor call.</a> So though it seems that the constructor calling creates the object but in fact the first step is the object creation and second is the constructor calling and not vice-versa.

<b>Ques</b> : Diff ways to initialise variables ?</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : There are 3 ways :
* Copy Initialisation `int a = 4;`
* Direct Initialisation `int a(4);`
* Uniform Initialisation `int a{4};`

<b>Ques</b> : What is the use of these keywords : `explicit` and `delete` in constructor definition? </br>
<b>Ans</b>  : The uses are as follows: 
* The keyword `delete` in a constructor definition means that any use of this constructor will be an error.
```
class A{
  A(int a) = delete;  // Type-safety to ensure that no object is created with an integer argument as parameter i.e we can't create ab object using this constructor.
}
```
* The keyword `explicit` in a constructor definition means that type conversion won't work with that impicit constructor.
```
class A {
  string s;
  public:
    A(int x)  {     // On-passing a char as argument to this constructor would work because it's implicitly converted
      s.resize(x)
  }

# constructor re-defined
explicit A (int x)  {   // But this won't compile as we have mentioned explicit thus compiler would look for exact call matching definition . which it won't find and thus throw an error.
  s.resize(x);
}
```


<b>Ques</b> : Can we have a constant object of a class ? </br>
<b>Ans</b>  : Yes. In constant object of a class we won't be able to modify any member variable refered to by that object of that class.  
* Also note that if a function returns constant then it's decleration must contain 'const'.
* Moreover we can do function overloading using 'const' i.e only 'const' objects can call 'const' functions.

<b>Ques</b> : What all operators can we overload ? </br>
<b>Ans</b>  : First, almost any existing operator in C++ can be overloaded. The exceptions are: conditional (?:), sizeof, scope (::), member selector (.), and member pointer selector (.\*).


<b>Ques</b> : Should I use exit() in my code ? </br>
<b>Ans</b>  : If you use the exit() function, your program will terminate and no destructors will be called. Be wary if youâ€™re relying on your destructors to do necessary cleanup work (e.g. write something to a log file or database before exiting).


<b>Ques</b> : Can I call a constructor from another constructor ? </br>
<b>Ans</b>  : Yes, Constructor delegating (calling constructor from constructor) is possible from C++11 on, Call it in the member initialisation list only.
```
class Hello {
  int a;
  Hello() { 
    cout <<"hello non-parameterised constructor"<<endl;
  } 
  Hello(int a) 
    : a {a},    // Value init
    : Hello()   // Constructor called
  {} 
```

<b>Ques</b> : Explain \*this ?  </br>
<b>Ans</b>  :  The compiler does the following for you :
```
// Thats what we call
obj.setId(12);      

// What compiler does
setID(&obj, 12);    // note that 'obj' has been changed from an object prefix to a function argument!
```


<b>Ques</b> : How to use initialisation list in Classes ?</br>
<b>Ans</b>  : See code below:
```
#Before initialisation list
class hello
{
  int a;
  char b;
  hello(int a , char b) {
    a=a;
    b=b;
  }
};

# After Initialisation list
class hello
{
  int a;
  char b;
  hello(int a , char b) 
   : a{a} ,
     b{b}     //  direct initialisation of variables.
  {
    cout <<"Hello Constructor called" <<endl;
  }
};
```  

-> Const and reference variables) must be initialized on the line they are declared because they cannot be assigned afterwards. (Obv.) This means : 
```
class hello {
  const int a ;
  hello()   {
    a = 5;      // ERROR - Cannot assign to a constant
  }
};


# But
class hello {
  const int a ;
  hello() :   a {5}     // Works - because we are not assigning here, we are using initialisation list , which is cool.
};
```

-> Static members are not associated with class objects , nor are static functions.
```
class Hello {
  static int a;
  int val;
  static getVal(){  return val; }
};

int main()  {
  Hello::a  = 2;
  Hello::getVal();
}
Note : Cannot have static constructors though.
```

-> C++11 introduced new keyword constexpr, which ensures that a constant must be a compile-time constant:
```
constexpr double gravity { 9.8 }; // ok, the value of 9.8 can be resolved at compile-time
```
-> Note that making a specific member function a friend requires the full definition for the class of the member function to have been seen first. Keep in mind that a `friend function` is not a member function.

-> Use chrono for timing your code.

-> When overloading the stream operators i.e input-stream (istream) for `cin` or output-stream(ostream) for `cout` ,  always return a reference to `left-hand` parameter becuase it helps in chaining , which won't be possible incase the overloaded function returns `void`.

-> By default, C++ internally provides copy constructor and assignment operator, but they do `shallow copy` , thus when dealing with `dynamic memory allocation` always create your own versions of these operators and constructors.
